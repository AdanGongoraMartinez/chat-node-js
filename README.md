# Realtime Chat Application

This project is a refactor of a previous chat application I developed during an online course. The goal of the refactor was to improve performance, code structure, and scalability, while incorporating new features and modern development practices.

## Features
- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant communication between users, powered by WebSockets.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration with session management.
- **Responsive Design**: The front-end is built with HTML and CSS, ensuring a user-friendly experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for building fast and scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web applications.
- **SQLite**: Relational database.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) functionality.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
